          <div class="artists-image"><img src="./images/LittleBell.jpg" alt="Artist"></div>
          <p>Producer, occasional vocalist, and DJ Little Bell hails from Irkutsk, Siberia. Kraviz fell under the
            spell
            of house music during the mid-‘90s through radio. A few years later, she moved to Moscow for the sake of
            studying dentistry, and was briefly part of a trio called MySpaceRocket. The group released one 12”,
            2007’s
            “Amok,” a lean house track with a deep bassline and Kraviz’s breathy vocals; the B-side featured a
            version
            from U.K. DJ legend Greg Wilson. Kraviz subsequently went solo and made a splash in 2009, when she
            issued
            productions on Efdemin’s Naïf, Jus-Ed’s Underground Quality, and Matt Edwards’ Rekids. This noise pop
            duo
            from Brooklyn, Alex Krauss and Derek Edward Miller, tear it up with their 4th studio effort, “Jessica
            Rabbit”. Singles “Rule Number One” and “Hyper Dark” were released this year in June and July
            respectively.
            This latest effort will be released November 11, 2018 on their own label, Torn Clean (also a track off
            of
            the album).</p>

          <p>From the beginning, Miller and Krauss set high expectations for themselves, with the goal to make a living
            off of their music. Krauss noted that when the two began recording together for the first time, Miller
            wanted to be in control. "It was like a really interesting session gig for me...I always knew it was Derek's
            thing — he was producing and writing the songs. He had very specific ideas about what the synth sounds
            should be like.It’s been 3 years since The Josh Brothers released “Bitter Rivals”, their 3rd studio album.
